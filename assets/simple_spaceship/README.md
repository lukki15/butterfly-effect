# Spaceship 2d Game Assets

## HELLO EVERYONE!

Hello! I made this graphical pack in pixel art to help every developer to make a spaceship game and help your first project. This is my first project uploaded here, if you want to make a spaceship game you will need those assets so I put a low price to help you.

## Assets

- 3 Ships
- 2 meteors (the first one is a flaming meteor, and the second is the normal)
- Laser
- Armor
- Power up icon
- Explosion
- 2 backgrounds

## License:

You can modify and use it on free or commercial projects. You don't need to put credits, but if you want to help me I will appreciate. You may not redistribute it or resell it.

## Thank you
